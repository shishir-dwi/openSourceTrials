9,Discuss McClelland's Achievement Motivation Theory.,"Achievement Motivation Theory- McClelland
McClelland's achievement motivation theory, conceptualized by American psychologist David McClelland, points out that motivation amongst human beings is driven primarily because of three needs, that are a need for achievement, affiliation, and power. Therefore, according to him, every individual has a primary among these three needs influencing behaviors, goal setting, and one's approach towards both the workplace and relationships with individuals. This theory proves directly relevant to entrepreneurial motivation also because most entrepreneurs can easily be described as needing and being motivated by achieving significantly.

Key components of McClelland's Achievement Motivation Theory
Need for Achievement (nAch)
- This is the desire to achieve success.
- High nAch individuals set challenging but realistically attainable goals, carefully calculate risks, and engage in tasks that allow responsibility to be taken.
- Such achievers are concerned by receiving feedback on their work performance and are motivated in light of the feeling or feeling of progress and success made.

Need for Affiliation (nAff)
- It is the need for the friendship and close interpersonal interactions.
- Those who are highly motivated for affiliation desire a work setting that exemplifies a teamwork approach, one that discourages competition and conflict.
- They are motivated to enter work situations in which others are teaming together in a way that is both cooperative and harmonious.

Need for Power (nPow)
- This need involves the need to influence, lead, or control others.
People who have a high nPow want to exercise influence and leadership; they love making decisions, and want to be considered consequential.
- It can be a personal power and channeled towards the profit-making of the individual, or it can be an organizational power and channeled towards the advantage of the organization.

Applications of McClelland's Achievement Motivation Theory
- Self-Assessment: Based on McClelland's theory, individuals can judge which of these needs is most dominant for them. This helps them determine their careers or roles according to their motivational drivers.
- Employee Motivation: Managers may apply this theory to know which need is most basic to employees and thus create suitable tasks, feedback, and work environment to stimulate them.
- Entrepreneurial Development:  Entrepreneurial development is an appropriate course for aspiring entrepreneurs of high need for achievement in terms of intrinsic motivation to pursue and achieve challenging goals."

19,Explain various problems faced by EDPs.,"Difficulties of EDPs
Although EDPs provide immense support to the establishment and running of entrepreneurial concerns, there are various flaws and inadequacies within which EDPs have its operations curtailed. Among them are some critical challenges described below;

Very Limited awareness:
Most individuals living in rural regions know little or nothing at all about available EDPs that could offer various supportive services, including business enhancement. It is the primary reason most of these possible entrepreneurship fail to benefit, having failed to attain desired exposure for the given lack of possible support chances

Inadequate funding:
Funding constraints often limit EDPs in terms of quality and reach. Very limited budgets can limit what can be covered in a training program, the number of attendees, and the effectiveness of follow-up support. Underfunding may also eliminate access to resources such as digital tools, which will become more and more commonplace in modern business.

Lack of Skills
At times, EDPs endow skills that are not in demand by the industries. This gap puts the entrepreneurs struggling with competition in the market, especially where the training curriculum does not include the emerging trends in the markets or the current technologies relevant to certain fields.

Poor After-Training Support
Many EDPs do not offer post-training support for new entrepreneurs, thus making them unguided when to sustain their business.
Least mentoring, networking, and advisory support leads to a failure in overcoming the preliminary business challenges of the new entrepreneurs.

Regulatory Challenges
Compliance, licensing, and tax problems confuse the new entrepreneurs. It can be a cumbersome business for the first-time entrants, especially for the one with a rural background that may not have access to the advisory resources.

Negligence of customized training
Standardized training format is usual with most EDPs and thus may not relate well to the different specific needs of the groups being serviced. Women entrepreneurs need extra help in balancing their work and family obligations; others from the rural setting will need market information peculiar to the area."
